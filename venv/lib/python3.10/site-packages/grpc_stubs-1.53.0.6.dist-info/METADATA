gRPC Typing Stubs for Python

This is a PEP-561-compliant stub-only package which provides type information of
[gRPC](https://grpc.io>).

Install using pip:

    pip install grpc-stubs

Tests (courtesy of [pytest-mypy-plugins](https://github.com/typeddjango/pytest-mypy-plugins>):

    pip install -r requirements-dev.txt
    ./tools.sh test


## Python Support

grpc-stubs is tested with 3.7 or later, but ideally it should support Python 3.6 as
grpc still supports this. Python 3.6 had to be disabled in the tests due to
various cascading fiascos and a lack of time to contend with them. Feel free
to submit a PR if you'd like to see it returned, or open issues. Ensure that
you supply an MRE as per the contributing guidelines below.
